## Info

Here I plan to upload several Azure VM related scripts.

Currently work in progress scripts:
- Install Azure PowerShell - script will download, check and install/update and configure: vscode + extensions Azure and PowerShell extensions, PowerShell AZ module, oh-my-posh with AzureIsFun theme

- Get-AZVMInfo - get all info about Azure VMs

- Get-AZBackupInfo - get info about Azure backups, for all or individual VMs

- Get-AZUpdateInfo - get info from Azure Update Management

- Get-AZNetworkInfo - gets info about Azure Networks


More functions to be added later.
