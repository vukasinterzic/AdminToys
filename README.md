# AdminToys

This module started as a collection of few functions to help with daily tasks. Module will grow over time and new useful functions will be added.

Functions are designed in the way so they can be used individually, or as a part of a larger script. If you use variable $Credential to store credentials, you won't need to enter credentials for each function. Individual functions do not check for remote computer accessibility. You can do that once and then pass only accessible computers to individual functions. It is designed like this to avoid multiple checks. Results can be saved in new object, and then presented and sorted in various formats.

## Functions:
